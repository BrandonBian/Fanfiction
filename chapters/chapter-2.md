"Wow, Nanachi, have you ever seen anything like this?" Riko asked in amazement as she gazed upon the strange, otherworldly sights that surrounded her. The fossilized buildings of what seemed like ancient relics poked out in every direction, stretching up and up as if they would never end. The ground beneath her feet was made of what appeared to be stones of different colors, blended together like a river of mixed colors. And amidst it all, Riko could see strange, otherworldly creatures roaming and floating and flying through and within the fossilized buildings of ancient civilizations. There were Hermit Rats scurrying around the group, curious in nature but quick to bite if provoked. And looming in the far distance were the Turbinid-Dragons, towering beasts that were as deadly as an entire swarm of Amaranthine-Deceptors. Riko couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and excitement as she gazed upon these creatures and their exotic surroundings. "This is incredible," she breathed, her eyes sparkling with curiosity and wonder. "I never imagined anything like this could exist."

"Nnaaa... watch your step, Riko, or you might just fall through a crack and end up like a Hermit Rat's lunch," Nanachi said in a sarcastic tone, her slanted pupils watching Riko's every move with caution. "You seem to forget the dangers of the Abyss quite easily." As Riko continued to marvel at their surroundings, Nanachi muttered to herself, "Nnaaa... what an energetic kid, even after what happened back in the village, she is soon to recover her mood and continue on with her optimism." 

"Ha! I won't forget that," Riko chuckled nervously, aware of her previous near-death experiences in the Abyss. "But can you blame me for getting excited? Look at all of this! It's amazing." She turned to Nanachi, her eyes shining with curiosity. "Do you think we'll find anything valuable here?" Nanachi tilted her head, considering the question. "Nnaaa... it's hard to say," she said thoughtfully. "The sixth layer is known for its treasures, but it's also one of the most dangerous places in the Abyss. We should be careful and not get too greedy." Riko nodded in agreement, her excitement tempered by Nanachi's caution. "Right. We'll be careful. But let's not forget to have some fun too, okay?" Nanachi's expression softened at Riko's words. "Nnaaa... of course, Riko," she said with a small smile.

Reg walked behind Nanachi and Riko, his eyes constantly scanning the environment for any sign of danger. The backpack he carried on his back seemed to weigh nothing to him, despite its bulk. It was almost as if he was made for this kind of journey. As he walked, Reg couldn't help but think about Faputa. He had known her before, but due to his loss of memory, he couldn't remember much about her. However, he was thrilled that she had decided to join their team and continue with them into the depths of the Abyss. He felt a sense of warmth and familiarity towards her, even though he couldn't quite put his finger on why. Perhaps it was the antinomy of Faputa's childlike innocence and her incredible power that drew him to her, a reminder that even in this dark and dangerous abyss, there could still be moments of innocence and wonder. Regardless, Reg was happy to have her by his side. He hoped that as they continued their journey, he would be able to recover more of his memories, including those of Faputa. With these thoughts, Reg couldn't help but extend his robotic arm and pat Faputa on her head, feeling her soft fur against his metal fingertips. "Fa...", Faputa purred and stretched in response, her eyes sparkling with happiness. Despite her powerful abilities and sometimes unpredictable behavior, Reg couldn't help but find Faputa's childlike innocence and cute demeanor endearing.

Nanachi turned her head to glance at Reg and Faputa's interaction. "Reg, don't let Faputa slip down and get hurt," she said in a humorous tone, knowing full well that Faputa was well-versed in the art of mischief. Faputa responded by stretching out on Reg's helmet, her white fur and hair enveloping him as she purred contentedly. "Sosu...Reg is so strong," she said in her usual primitive language. "Faputa is safe with him, Sosu." Nanachi couldn't help but smile at the sight of the two. Despite their differences in appearance and abilities, they had formed an unlikely bond, one that seemed unbreakable.

As they continued their journey, the team encountered a deep chasm, stretching across their path. The gap was too wide to jump over and too deep to climb down into. The only thing bridging the two sides was a remnant of what seemed to be an ancient belltower that had fallen across the chasm, forming a precarious and narrow bridge. Riko's eyes lit up with excitement as she saw this seemingly adventurous path to continue their journey. "Wow, this is so cool!" she exclaimed. "I bet we can cross it if we're careful." Nanachi, on the other hand, had reservations. "Nnaaa...Riko, I don't think it's a good idea to take such a risk," she warned. "We don't know how stable that tower is, and we could fall to our deaths." Riko, however, was determined. "Come on, Nanachi, where's your sense of adventure?" she teased: "We can do this!". Reg, who had caught up with the duo, listened to the conversation with a worried expression. "Nanachi is right, Riko. We shouldn't take unnecessary risks. We don't know how stable, or even how old, that belltower is - it could break at any moment," he said, trying to reason with her. "I can go ahead and find another way around. It might take some time, but it's better than risking our lives." Riko looked at him, determination in her eyes. "I understand your concerns, Reg. But we're already so far in, we can't turn back now. Besides, we're a team. We'll stick together no matter what." Nanachi sighed. "Nnaaa... you're both too stubborn for your own good. Fine, we'll cross the bell, but we'll do it carefully." Faputa remained silent, but Reg could sense her tension. She was always on high alert, ready to act if anything went wrong.

As they began to cross the chasm by walking upon the belltower, Reg kept a close eye on Riko and Nanachi. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was going to go wrong. The bell creaked and groaned under their weight, and he felt a chill run down his spine. As they were about to reach the middle point of the tower, there was a sudden, deafening roar. The ground shook violently, and a blast of heat washed over them. "Woah..what was that?!" Riko cried out, fear etched on her face. "It must have been a geo-thermal explosion," Nanachi yelled over the noise, "we need to get out of here!" Reg quickly grabbed Riko's hand and pulled her towards him. "Hold on tight," he said as he extended his arm and used it to swing them both towards the other end of the belltower. Nanachi followed closely behind, her movements lithe and nimble as she navigated the shaking structure. As they were about to reach the other side, the belltower began to give away. Reg's arm extended further, as he swung Riko towards the edge. But as she landed, she stumbled and almost fell off the edge. Faputa, who had been silent until then, sprang into action. She leapt from Reg's helmet and flew towards Riko, grabbing her arm just in time and pulling her to safety. "Fa...Faputa, you saved me!" Riko exclaimed in amazement, her heart racing with adrenaline. Faputa responded with a nod, her expression serious.

Reg's heart was pounding in his chest as he landed on the ground and rushed to check on Riko. He found her sitting up, a bit shaken but thankfully unharmed. He let out a deep breath of relief and turned to Faputa, who had landed beside him. "You saved her life, Faputa," he said, his voice filled with gratitude. "I don't know what we would have done without you." Faputa simply nodded, a small smile on her lips. Reg turned to Riko, his expression softening as he took in her relieved smile. "Are you okay?" he asked, his concern evident in his voice. Riko nodded, still a bit stunned by what had just happened. "I'm okay," she said, her voice shaking slightly. "Thanks to Faputa." In the meanwhile, Nanachi, who was closest to the other end of the bell tower, had managed to scramble to safety just in time. As she looked back at the crumbling tower, she let out a relieved sigh: "Nnaaa... that was too close," she said, her slanted pupils still wide with fear.

Riko looked around at her companions, a wave of guilt washing over her. "I'm sorry," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "I shouldn't have been so reckless. I could have gotten us all killed." Nanachi shook her head. "Nnaaa... we all took a risk by crossing the bell tower," she said, her tone gentle. "It's not your fault, Riko." Reg nodded in agreement, a reassuring smile on his face. "We're a team, Riko," he said, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "We face dangers together. We'll get through this, no matter what." Faputa looked up at Riko, her eyes filled with understanding. "Sosu...Faputa knows that Riko is brave," she said softly, her eyes glancing at the white whistle upon Riko's chest: "Faputa is proud to be her friend." Riko smiled weakly at her words, grateful for the team's support and understanding. 

For a moment the team stood there in silent, until Nanachi looked at Riko with a small smile: "Nnaaa... looks like we have more to worry about than just the Abyss itself. We have to watch out for Riko's recklessness too," she said teasingly, her slanted pupils softening. Riko blushed, slightly embarrassed by her previous actions. "I know, I know. I won't take unnecessary risks anymore," she said, her voice filled with determination. "We're lucky to have such a great team to support each other." Nanachi nodded in agreement. "Nnaaa... indeed we are. But for now, let's take a break and make sure we're all okay. We can't afford to make any more mistakes."

After lightening their mood, the team started to examine their surroundings - this side of the chasm seems to be more lively, with green plants that resemble the first and second layers streching across the view. The air was fresher, and the sound of a nearby river could be heard. "Nnaaa... this side of the chasm seems to be less hostile," Nanachi observed, looking around at the lush vegetation. "We should take this opportunity to rest and recover our energy." Riko nodded in agreement, still feeling a bit shaken by the recent incident. As they wandered further into the foliage, they stumbled upon a small pond of water. It was surrounded by strange, exotic plants that seemed to glow and reflect in the sunlight. Faputa approached cautiously, examining each plant closely. After a few moments, she gave a small nod. "Sosu...these plants seem benevolent," she said, giving the team the green light to rest near the pond. Riko immediately volunteered to cook a meal for everyone, and Reg pulled out a fish that they had traded from the Village of Ilblu.

The aroma of the cooking fish soup filled the air, and everyone's stomachs rumbled in anticipation. Riko worked her magic, carefully preparing the ingredients and adding her own special touch to the soup. As they ate, the team savored the warmth of the meal and the peaceful surroundings. Reg complimented Riko on her cooking, and Nanachi hummed in agreement. Faputa, on the other hand, was more reserved. She had never eaten cooked food before and was hesitant to try it. But Riko insisted, holding out a bowl of soup to her with a gentle smile. "Come on, Faputa. You're part of our team now. Do share this meal with us," she said. Faputa hesitated for a moment, then took a small sip of the soup. Her eyes widened in surprise as she savored the taste, and she quickly emptied her bowl, eyes sparkled with intensity as she stared at the cooking pot, her stomach grumbling with hunger. Riko noticed her gaze and chuckled. "Want some more, Faputa?" she asked, holding out the pot. Faputa eagerly nodded, and Riko ladled more soup into her bowl. As she ate, the rest of the team laughed and chatted - the tense atmosphere from earlier had dissipated, replaced by a sense of camaraderie and joy.

As the team finished their meal, they all began to feel drowsy. Despite the lack of a sun or night, the atmosphere of the sixth layer seemed to lull them into a sense of tranquility. They found a cozy spot among the lush greenery and settled down to rest, with Reg and Faputa taking turns keeping watch throughout the time. As the team settled down to rest, they couldn't help but reflect on the events of the day. The close call on the bell tower had reminded them of the dangers that lurked around every corner in the Abyss. But it had also shown them the true value of their teamwork and the strength of their bonds. Faputa, who had once been a wild and unpredictable creature, had proven herself to be an indispensable member of the team, with her quick thinking and bravery saving them all from disaster. As they drifted off to sleep, the team felt a sense of excitement and anticipation for what lay ahead. They knew that they were about to embark on an extraordinary adventure, one that would test them to their limits and take them to places they had never even dreamed of. And they were ready for it.
