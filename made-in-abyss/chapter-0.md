Deep beneath the earth lies a vast and mysterious realm known as the Abyss, a place of great wonder and danger. Its depths hold treasures beyond imagining, artifacts and relics of a forgotten age that have lured countless adventurers and explorers to their doom. But the Abyss is not only a place of beauty and riches. It is also a place of darkness and mystery, full of strange and terrifying creatures that lurk in the shadows. The Abyss is a land of extremes, where the wonders of the natural world clash with the horrors of the unknown. And yet, despite its dangers, the people of Orth have long been drawn to its depths, seeking to uncover its secrets and claim its treasures as their own.

Riko had heard the stories of the Abyss from the time she was a child, tales of a place of unparalleled beauty and danger, where the very air seemed to hum with the energy of the unknown. Her mother had been one of the greatest explorers of the Abyss, a White Whistle whose legend still echoed through the halls of Orth. And Riko, orphaned and alone, longed to follow in her footsteps, to brave the dangers of the Abyss and uncover the mysteries that lay hidden beneath its surface. It was a dream that seemed impossible, until the day she met Reg, a strange robot boy with no memory of his past. Together, they would embark on a journey into the heart of the Abyss, facing challenges and dangers beyond their wildest imaginings.

With Reg by her side, Riko knew that her dream of exploring the Abyss might finally be within reach. Together, they began their descent into the depths, leaving behind the safety and comfort of Orth to face the unknown. The journey would not be an easy one. They would encounter strange creatures and treacherous terrain, and face dangers beyond their imagining. But Riko was undeterred. The stories of her mother's exploits in the Abyss had filled her with a sense of awe and wonder, and she was determined to follow in her footsteps, no matter the cost. With each step, they drew closer to the heart of the Abyss, to the secrets and treasures that lay hidden within its depths.

Together, Riko and Reg begin their descent into the Abyss, facing many dangers and challenges along the way. In the 1st layer, they encounter a variety of strange creatures, including the Crimson Splitjaw, and discover the cursed flowers known as the Corpse-Weeper. In the 2nd layer, they face even greater challenges, such as the deadly Inbyo and the fearsome Great Fault, as they make their way towards the Seeker Camp. In the 3rd layer, Riko and Reg encounter the legendary White Whistle Ozen the Immovable, who tests their abilities and reveals the dark secrets of the Abyss. They also meet Ozen's apprentice Marulk, who shows them kindness and provides them with valuable information. In the 4th layer, Riko and Reg become trapped in the treacherous forest known as the Goblet of Giants, where they encounter the kind-hearted but mysterious Nanachi, who helps them escape and recover from their injuries. After their encounter with Nanachi, Riko and Reg continue their journey deeper into the Abyss, facing new challenges and dangers as they seek to uncover the secrets of the Abyss and the truth about Reg's past.

Their journey into the Abyss took Riko and Reg through a series of trials and tribulations. From the towering trees of the 1st layer to the perilous Inbyo-filled tunnels of the 2nd, the duo persevered despite the danger. In the 3rd layer, they encountered the legendary White Whistle Ozen the Immovable, who tested their abilities and revealed the dark secrets of the Abyss. Despite her gruff exterior, Ozen provided valuable insights and even a new companion in the form of her apprentice Marulk. The pair continued to descend into the Abyss, reaching the treacherous 4th layer where they became trapped in the deadly forest of the Goblet of Giants. It was there that they met Nanachi, a skilled but mysterious creature who helped them recover from their injuries and provided shelter from the dangers of the Abyss.

The 5th layer of the Abyss proved to be a brutal and unforgiving place, as Riko, Reg, and Nanachi encountered the notorious White Whistle Bondrewd and his deadly experiments. Together, they faced some of the greatest dangers yet, with Reg losing his arm in a brutal battle with Bondrewd's minions. In the midst of this chaos, they met a girl named Prushka, who quickly became an important member of their team. Despite her sheltered upbringing and lack of experience in the Abyss, Prushka showed a remarkable bravery and strength of character, bonding quickly with the team as they fought to survive in the face of Bondrewd's madness. But the dangers of the 5th layer proved too much, and Prushka ultimately lost her life in a tragic sacrifice, giving her companions the chance to escape and continue their journey deeper into the Abyss. Though her time with them was brief, Prushka's bravery and spirit lived on, as the team continued their journey with her as a white whistle.

The journey of Riko, Reg, and Nanachi took them deep into the heart of the Abyss, to the treacherous 6th layer, where they discovered a strange and wondrous village of creatures known as the Narehate. The village, known as Irumyuui, was formed from the remains of countless creatures that had been drawn to the Abyss and fused together in a beautiful yet eerie landscape. As they explored the village, the team encountered the enigmatic and powerful princess Faputa, who possessed incredible abilities and a fierce independent spirit. Despite initial hostilities, Faputa eventually joined their team, setting them on a new course deeper into the Abyss, and towards even greater challenges and dangers. As they set out on a new journey deeper into the Abyss, accompanied by their new ally Faputa, Riko, Reg, and Nanachi were filled with both excitement and trepidation, for they knew that the path ahead would be filled with danger and challenge, but also with wonder and discovery. So began their new adventures, venturing into the unknown and seeking to uncover the secrets and mysteries that lay hidden within the depths of the Abyss.
